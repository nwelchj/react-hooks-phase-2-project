# Rep-Te-Book
This application is a play on Facebook but tailored to reptile owners. One can post a picture of their favorite reptiles and like images. A person can like the images they deem worthy. The last thing I worked on was making it so someone could post an image. So posting the feature of the application doesn't work at the moment

## Features 
Notes: At the current moment I do not have all the features I would like in this application, I would like to have a way you can submit your picture but that was a little more complicated than I thought it would be... but here are some of the features I have so far. 
  - Navigate through pages
  - Have a Home page
  - Have a like button
  - have a submit 
		   - can't post a picture just yet sadly - working 


## Make modifications 
You are welcome to chnage this application how you like just make sure you make your own copy  of the repo and submit to that rather then the master
